;;; Commentary:

;; On OS X (and perhaps elsewhere) the $PATH environment variable and
;; `exec-path' used by a windowed Emacs instance will usually be the
;; system-wide default path, rather than that seen in a terminal
;; window.

;; This library allows the user to set Emacs' `exec-path' and $PATH
;; from the shell path, so that `shell-command', `compile' and the
;; like work as expected.

;; Installation:

;; ELPA packages are available on Marmalade and Melpa. Alternatively, place
;; this file on a directory in your `load-path', and explicitly require it.

;; Usage:
;;
;;     (require 'exec-path-from-shell) ;; if not using the ELPA package
;;     (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
;;
;; If you use your Emacs config on other platforms, you can instead
;; make initialization conditional as follows:
;;
;;     (when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
;;       (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
;;
;; To copy the values of other environment variables, you can use
;; `exec-path-from-shell-copy-env', e.g.
;;
;;     (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "PYTHONPATH")

;;; Code:

(defgroup exec-path-from-shell nil
  "Make Emacs use shell-defined values for $PATH etc."
  :prefix "exec-path-from-shell-"
