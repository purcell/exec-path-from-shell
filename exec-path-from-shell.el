;;; Commentary:

;; On OS X (and perhaps elsewhere) the $PATH environment variable and
;; `exec-path' used by a windowed Emacs instance will usually be the
;; system-wide default path, rather than that seen in a terminal
;; window.

;; This library allows the user to set Emacs' `exec-path' and $PATH
;; from the shell path, so that `shell-command', `compile' and the
;; like work as expected.

;; Installation:

;; ELPA packages are available on Marmalade and Melpa. Alternatively, place
;; this file on a directory in your `load-path', and explicitly require it.

;; Usage:
;;
;;     (require 'exec-path-from-shell) ;; if not using the ELPA package
;;     (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
;;
;; If you use your Emacs config on other platforms, you can instead
;; make initialization conditional as follows:
;;
;;     (when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
;;       (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
;;
;; To copy the values of other environment variables, you can use
;; `exec-path-from-shell-copy-env', e.g.
;;
;;     (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "PYTHONPATH")

;;; Code:

(defun exec-path-from-shell-getenv (name)
  "Get the environment variable NAME from the user's shell.

Execute $SHELL as interactive login shell, have it output the
variable of NAME and return this output as string."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (call-process (getenv "SHELL") nil (current-buffer) nil
                  "--login" "-i" "-c" (concat "echo __RESULT=$" name))
    (when (re-search-backward "__RESULT=\\(.*\\)" nil t)
      (match-string 1))))

;;;###autoload
(defun exec-path-from-shell-copy-env (name)
  "Set the environment variable $NAME from the user's shell.

Return the value of the environment variable."
  (interactive "sCopy value of which environment variable from shell? ")
  (setenv name (exec-path-from-shell-getenv name)))

;;;###autoload
(defun exec-path-from-shell-initialize ()
  "Initialize environment from the user's shell.

Set $MANPATH, $PATH and `exec-path' from the corresponding
variables in the user's shell."
