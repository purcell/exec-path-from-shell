exec-path-from-shell
=====================

A GNU Emacs library to ensure environment variables inside Emacs look
the same as in the user's shell.

Motivation
----------

Ever find that a command works in your shell, but not in Emacs?

This happens a lot on OS X, where an Emacs instance started from the GUI inherits a
default set of environment variables.

This library solves this problem by copying important environment
variables from the user's shell: it works by asking your shell to print out the
variables of interest, then copying them into the Emacs environment.

Compatibility
-------------

At a minimum, this package assumes that your shell is at least UNIX-y: if
`(getenv "SHELL")` evaluates to something like `".../cmdproxy.exe"`, this
package probably isn't for you.

Further, if you use a non-POSIX-standard shell such as `tcsh` or `fish`, your
shell will be asked to execute `sh` as a subshell in order to print
out the variables in a format which can be reliably parsed. `sh` must
be a POSIX-compliant shell in this case.

Note that shell variables which have not been exported as environment
variables (e.g. using the "export" keyword) may not be visible to
`exec-path-from-shell'.

Installation
------------

Installable packages are available via MELPA.  Alternatively, [download][]
the latest release or clone the repository, and install
`exec-path-from-shell.el` with `M-x package-install-file`.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your `init.el` (after calling `package-initialize`):

```el
(when (memq window-system '(ns x nil))
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
```

This sets `$MANPATH`, `$PATH` and `exec-path` from your shell, but only on OS X
and Linux.

You can copy values of other environment variables by customizing
`exec-path-from-shell-variables` before invoking
`exec-path-from-shell-initialize`, or by calling
`exec-path-from-shell-copy-env`, e.g.:

```el
(exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "PYTHONPATH")
```

This function may also be called interactively.

Note that your shell will inherit Emacs's environment variables when
it is run -- to avoid surprises your config files should therefore
set the environment variables to their exact desired final values,
i.e. don't do this:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

but instead do this:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```
